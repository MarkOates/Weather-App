# Project

Develop a web based weather application that displays the 10 coldest cities in Canada along with the temperature.

Bonus points for the following:
*   The application has a server component which exposes an API that the client consumes
*   Two sources of weather data are used - one is API based and the other is data scraped from a weather web site.
*   The application interface updates in real time
*   The web app is deployed in a native mobile container
*   The application interface displays the 10 coldest cities on a map.
