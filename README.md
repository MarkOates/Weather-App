Weather-App
===========

Weather-App is a project given to me as part of a job application.  See "specs.md" for more information regarding the requirements.

To create this app, I'll use the following platforms/tools:
*   Apache server (An .htaccess file includes RewriteRule for clean URLs)
*   PHP 5.5.9
*   Angular.js 1.2.26

To make development more interesting, I'll be making the app with the following conditions in mind:
1.   inside a VM running Ubuntu 14.04
2.   using Sublime Text 2 for coding
5.   starting with a MVP and then expanding features from there
4.   intending to include all of the bonus points of the project ("Deploy in a mobile container" might take some extra leg work)
2.   keeping a steady version control record (Git w/GitHub)
4.   keeping the codebase to a minimum for clarity (no MVC, for example). 
3.   building the front end with Angular.js
6.   using good practices for developing in teams (README.md files, sensical commits)
7.   and... any graphic design work will be done in Photoshop CS3 (Windows)
