Weather-App
===========

Weather-App is a project given to me as part of a job application.  See "specs.md" for more information regarding the requirements.

The meat of the project is contained in the "internal" folder, the rest is mostly architectural.  Inside there are the front-facing pages (index.php, and api.php), and the scraper (scraper_test.php, at the time of this writing).

To create this app, I'm using the following platforms/tools:

*   Apache server (An .htaccess file includes RewriteRule for clean URLs)
*   PHP 5.5.9
*   Angular.js 1.2.26

To make things more interesting, I'll be developing with the following practices:

1.   Ubuntu 14.04 in VMware
2.   Sublime Text 2
5.   going for a MVP, then expanding features
4.   intending to include all of the bonus points of the project
2.   using version control and public repository (GitHub)
4.   keeping the codebase to a minimum for clarity (no MVC, for example). 
3.   front end with Angular.js
7.   and... any graphic design work will be done in Photoshop CS3 (Windows)
