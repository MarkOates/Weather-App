Weather-App
===========

Weather-App is a project given to me as part of a job application.  See "specs.md" for more information regarding the requirements.

To create this app, I'll use the following platforms/tools:

*   Apache server (An .htaccess file includes RewriteRule for clean URLs)
*   PHP 5.5.9
*   Angular.js 1.2.26

To make things more interesting, I'll be developing with the following practices:

1.   Ubuntu 14.04 in VMware
2.   Sublime Text 2
5.   going for a MVP, then expanding features
4.   intending to include all of the bonus points of the project
2.   using version control and public repository (GitHub)
4.   keeping the codebase to a minimum for clarity (no MVC, for example). 
3.   front end with Angular.js
7.   and... any graphic design work will be done in Photoshop CS3 (Windows)
